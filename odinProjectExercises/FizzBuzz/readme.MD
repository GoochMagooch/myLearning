The goal of this project is to create a script that takes user input (number, up to 100) and then prints all numbers from 1 to the chosen number, but for multiples of 3 it prints out "Fizz", for mulitples of 5 it prints out "Buzz", and for multiples of both it prints out "FizzBuzz"

Notes and Planning:
multiples of 3 up to 100:
3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99
multiples of 5 up to 100:
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100
multiples of both up to 100:
15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90
